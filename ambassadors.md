# Our job

Source Summits are an inspiring environment. People leave "feeling accelerated" because they've had open, direct conversations where they've learned something to address their most pressing challenges.  They also leave with new relationships that show potential in growing strong and valuable.

For example, the founder of an solar electricity project was at a Summit in Kenya, and he simply asked, "is there anyone here who can help me with a Rwandan bid?  I have no contacts or experience there."  And he found a few Rwandans who could help.  

Our alumni tend to be very excited and happy with their experience, but the helpful, open environment is hard to explain to someone who hasn't been there before.

So, our job is start creating that environment now.  

As ambassadors, we do this through one-on-one connections, learning their challenges and learning about their recent wins.  The core curation team also supports them by helping them craft their session, and by facilitating it with them on the day.  Together, these approaches help everyone see the value for themself (rather than in abstract), and set expectations that this will be a friendly, open place where everyone is trying to help everyone else.


# The Source Summit format

Summits are like a bustling conference, with tons of rooms and fast, 30-minute sessions on different topics. Sessions are usually a short talk followed by a discussion, workshops or other interactive formats. 

The difference from a standard conference is that the sessions are planned by the participants that day!

Source Summit works well because we draw different disciplines and backgrounds together.  Each group we connect needs an ambassador as our eyes and ears.

Summits are an open, interactive, and multi-track.  We focus on the doers sharing their experience - keeping it practical and actionable.  And the large number of sessions at any given time, as well as the fact that the sessions are determined by the participants themselves, help make sure everyone has very relevant options available to them. Itâ€™s a high-energy day focused on broad learning and helping each other.

The day itself starts with everyone gathering around an empty schedule, and everyone has the opportunity to step up and suggest a topic for a session.  People come on stage to explain their session for 30 seconds, and choose a place and time from the empty slots. 

Less than an hour later, we have a conference built for and by the participants! (It works like magic - we'll teach you how to do this magic trick!)

Everyone has the power over the agenda, to contribute their experience, and to interact with thought-leaders and experienced practitioners. Participants drive the topics based on their needs.

# Preparation 
You've been selected as an ambassador because you know some of the participants well. You're in a great position to help us determine their challenges and their successes - you're our eyes and ears.

It's our job to prepare for this by making sure there are 30-50% of the sessions that we've helped mould, based on the needs of our various constituents.

If you've ever said to someone, "I think I know someone who could help you with that", then you have the fundamental idea of our role as ambassadors.  The key difference is that we're a team - and work together to find the best matches between needs and experience.  The most useful experience to match your people's needs is often from a different constituent community - so the other ambassadors help with finding the right introduction.

# Timeline

1. Each ambassador shares challenges and successes
1. We discuss (over short emails) opportunities to connect challenges to experience
1. The curation team decides which session topics to curate, and ambassadors connect the participant to the curation team.
1. The curation team works with each participant asking them to prepare.

So, we start with looking through our constituents, and making a quick list of their most pressing and most common needs.  We also make a list of their wins, skills and experience.

Then we share these lists among all ambassadors, looking for good matches.

The Source Institute curation team works with you to get a sense of common needs, and we start to suggest ideas for sessions - which you double-check with your constituents.

When we start the day, and invite people to join us at the schedule to make suggestions, we'll know at least a third of the people who do so, because we've invited them and worked with them to prepare their session.
