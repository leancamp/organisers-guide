# Getting Started

Thanks for volunteering to organise Leancamp!

We have a long-term view of supporting an internationally-connected, inter-disciplinary, inclusive community-centred around startups. Leancamp is for the startup community, by the startup community.

This means we make sure organisers have an as easy, stress-free time as possible – and can focus only on the needs of the community.

So, Leancamp is radically different from most startup events. We’ve removed things like up-front payments, the need to get sponsors, and the need to build a big team.

The Quickstart will get you rolling, and you'll be able to learn as you go. As you do, you'll understand how the way we do things is going to save you a ton of time, and how you’ll be powerful catalyst in your startup community.

# Quickstart

Here's a general idea of how things work overall. Your Advisor will help you learn the Leancamp Way as you go.

The first thing is to seek the easy path:
1. Get a Leancamp Leader to help you. You can find them at a Leancamp, or ask Sal to make some intros.
2. Contact local conferences to open partnership discussions. The basic idea is that conferences benefit from including Leancamp under their umbrella. They get:
* a much stronger sense of community at their conference, because Leancamp runs first and sparks a lot of relationships between conference attendees.
* stronger grassroots startup credibility, since Leancamp is a startup-friendly price and attracts well-respected founders and experts
* access to a better set of speakers, since strong founders are often motivated to come to Leancamp more than more formal conferences





If the partnership route doesn't work out, here's plan B:

1. Get 2-3 local organisers involved. Ideally, someone who's seen an open space before. You don't need a bigger team, yet.
2. Start building the email list at http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/leancamp for your city. This is very important, as it'll make our lives much easier once the venue is confirmed and we need to sell the first tickets.
3. Before moving on to the next steps, get Advisor on your team. Ask any Leancamp Leader or prior organiser if you know one. If not, ask Sal and he'll intro you. Your  Advisor's job is to provide continuity, so your Leancamp experience is consistent with other cities. They'll do this by being part of your core organisers team, included in your communication and meetings, your connection to the Leancamp Leaders group.
4. Sit down with your Advisor for 20 minutes to plan a quick budget, and show you the budget of previous events.  Get an idea of necessary ticket prices and volumes to break even. You’ll plan out 2 more budgets, the "relax" point where we'll no longer need to hustle to sell tickets, and the maximim size, when we can add a lot of extras to make a better event. 
5. Find a venue. Make requests to all possible Venue Partners at once.
6. Start reaching out to invite local community leaders to be Leancamp Ambassadors.
7. Once a date is set, announce the event and release Earlyvangelist tickets.
8. Get the conversations going about topics. Setup your event as a category at leancamp.uservoice.com and encourage speakers and ambassadors to suggest sessions there.
9. After Earlyvangelist tickets are sold, we look at who's attending and consider balancing the event out. If there's one group that is particularly strong, we don't want them to overwhelm the event, so we release tickets access codes for discount tickets to underrepresented communities with the help of our Ambassadors.

# What is Leancamp?

Leancamp is an open, interactive, multi-track event – which connects Lean, Agile and Design-led practitioners. It’s a high-energy day focused on broad learning and knowledge transfer.

Leancamp is a bustling conference, with tons of rooms and fast, 30-minute sessions on different topics. Sessions can be talks, workshops, discussions, or other interactive formats. The difference is that the sessions are planned by the participants that day!

Everyone has the power over the agenda, to contribute their experience, and to interact with thought-leaders and experienced founders. Participants drive the topics based on their needs.

We use a technique known as Open Space, which is what Unconferences and Barcamps use.

Leading up to Leancamp, participants share what sessions they'd like to host. Leancamp starts with an empty schedule. People come on stage to explain their session for 30 seconds, and choose a place and time from the empty slots. An hour later, we have a conference built for and by the participants! (It works like magic - we'll teach you how to do this magic trick!)

# Leancamp Community Ethos

## Putting your city on the map

Global startup culture is becoming more networked and less top-down. There's a lot we can learn from Silicon Valley's example, but to succeed, we must build on our own strengths and on our own terms.
 
Leancamp, like emerging startup communities, doesn’t play a zero-sum game. We draw on the best by embracing connections to other places.

## Benefits to the local community

Leancamp is something people join, not attend.

We’ve seen Leancamp galvanise local startup communities. This happens by drawing on unlikely local startup supporters, and helping local cliques meet and help each other.

You’ll strengthen your local startup community because instead of just flying in external experts for a day, you’ll build up local strengths and help them build relationships with international leaders.

There’s a growing list of notable startup leaders who will happily jump on a plane for Leancamp – they’re a welcome committee for your city!


## Little Startup Superheroes

The culture we want to encourage is of humility, acceptance that we all have a lot to learn, and of a practical attitude to what works, what doesn't and in what context.  

It's great when we're graced by startup superheroes but that's a bonus.  They, just like everyone else, stand up and offer their session in the morning planning session.

This overrides the reverence we have to superstars, and allows us to focus on learning in context, from other who are 6 months or 1 year ahead of us, not just those who made it super-big.

This is how we get local stars like Andreas Klinger, Johanna Kollmann, Lukas Fittl and Tendayi Viki – people who keep strengthening their local startup community.

Leancamp builds community by identifying our emerging startup leaders, and giving them a platform to help others.











# 6 ways Leancamp is different.
## We’re about knowledge-sharing - inclusive to all.

We want to learn from each other. We want to seed a culture of sharing experiences, being open and humble about what doesn't work, and of seeking to learn from other communities rather than create cliques and exclusivity.  Leancamp played a big role in connecting entrepreneurship to user experience design, and Lean Startup to Business Model Generation.

We want to continue this tradition of connecting communities.

## We highly value local and practical knowledge.  
 Connecting to others actually doing this stuff is hugely valuable.  It's the practitioners who push the state of the art, and they're right at home. External people add to this, help build excitement, and create international relationships into your city, but the real value is in engaging the local community in a new way.

## No sponsors.

Leancamp is for us, by us.

We stay focused on that by keeping costs down and paying our own way.

We’ve tried sponsorship in many formats in the past, and while, at first or in tough times, it feels like an easy win, in every case it has come back as an extra distraction to manage when we really needed to focus on the core event.

If people approach us to sponsor, that’s great! We can use their help. Check the FAQ for ways they can contribute.

## Nobody gets paid.

Not even if you wrote a book! :)

This keeps things real and simple. With money off the table, we’re all aligned in a common community goal.


## People first.

People are our atomic unit.  Not startups or methodologies or investment rounds or content.

Our goal is to help people improve and achieve their goals, and help them find others who will help them on their journey. Thus, Leancamp puts a strong emphasis on people over everything else.  
 You won't see organisation logos all over Leancamp, instead we'll raise the profile of the people in those organisations who want to contribute. They are the champions that deserve to be heard, and people will only respect their organisations as a side-effect of respecting them.

You also won't see people rallying around a certain approach. Instead, you see leaders describing where they're at now, and discussing what to improve.

You will likely see people with books to sell, or some equivalent! But the emphasis is on the author, not their product, and Leancamp gives them the freedom to make further contributions unconstrained by their previous publications. For example, Brant Cooper and Alex Osterwalder put on workshops at Leancamp that were new and experimental.

## No room for egos.

Just like sponsors can't buy their way in but are welcome to contribute, nobody gets to "keynote" or gets preferential treatment. Everybody suggests their sessions together and the participants retain the option of voting with their feet.

On top of that, this frees us to work on an awesome event, rather than devote extra attention to specific people.

That said, recognized contributors should be promoted on the events page, and as with anyone else, we should help advise them about what the should do or what topics they should cover.

We can also offer to waive their ticket fee and possibly to pay for their flights if we can afford it. Many contributors are happy to buy their own flight, and take the risk of being reimbursed if we make the ticket sales.

# Your Role As An Organiser

At most conferences, the role of the organiser is to choose speakers and talks, and to sell sponsorship and tickets. Leancamp is different.

Rather than curate a conference, you'll be curating communities, building an intersection of topics by liaising with other community leaders, and encourage local practitioners to share their experiences.

Your main responsibility isn't to make a big event that makes money, it's to create a balanced event that fosters sharing and peer support.

## Where to focus to succeed.

I can't stress this enough: our satisfaction scores plateau at 60 people. After that, making the event bigger will not make it better!

The size of the event will take care of itself over time.  Engage the right balance of communities, and your Leancamp will grow on it's own. Don't worry if the first Leancamp is small. If the people there benefit, word will spread. You'll create demand; next time will be easier.

So don’t kill yourself! Save your energy.

# The Core Leancamp Process

Leancamp has a core process which has evolved over multiple events in different parts of the world. The core process is something we must stick to, otherwise we risk consequences that can suck up a lot of time and stress, or detract from the events quality and the Leancamp name. (We've learned from our mistakes!)

## Ideas & experiments

That said, when we have ideas to improve things, we love to experiment! With experiments, we get the Leancamp Leaders involved and we need to apply the PMCA loop. That is, we'll test them with some controls and a fall-back position, and measure their effect overall to ensure they are delivering more value the Leancamp participants.

If they prove of benefit, we'll roll them into the core process for every city to benefit!

## Affordable Loss & Runway

Leancamp, like most startups and non-profits, can’t afford to lose money. Plus, we don't pass the financial risk onto our local organisers. So, we work together, and manage our financial risk through MVPs.

## The Leancamp Minimum Viable Product

Our first learning goals is: **Is there enough demand for the event to break even?**

Sit down with your Advisor and look at budgets of previous Leancamp together.  Come up with a budget for a minimal Leancamp for at least 60 people, and therefore, a discounted ticket price.

The MVP usually is no more than announcing Leancamp is coming, and naming one or two speakers. This should attract a core group of earlyvangelists who want to participate without knowing exactly who will be speaking. 

An important part of this is we are attracting good contributors and will make the event more valuable to everyone else.

Selling these first tickets is our first real validation signal. Based on these revenues, we can make an informed decision of if we’re going to break even.


## Planning by getting options

Whether you’re asking a venue or speakers for availability dates, or considering topics for talks, or almost anything else, it’s important to always get a range of options.

Making Leancamp work has many different moving parts. Making the best Leancamp possible comes from communicating options to others so we can select an optimum together. (For example, you don’t want to choose just one talk from a speaker, then find out if they had prepped a different talk, a whole new community would join us.  Or that we prematurely set a date, and that meant some great speakers couldn’t attend.)

For example, with venues, don't ask for a single date. Instead, get a range of possible dates from the venue, so we can narrow that down later based on other constraints (availability of speakers, other events popping up, other Leancamps bringing in speakers we can share, etc.)

Don’t optimise by yourself. Communicate options frequently and promiscuously, to your Ambassadors and the Leancamp Leaders. Optimizations will appear.

## Choosing a location

See the checklist section for our venue requirements.

Generally, we only work with venues operated by people who already support startups or innovation, and who have someone personally interested in supporting Leancamp. Things go much more smoothly when we're aligned in our goals, and have an internal ally, rather than simply a venue offering space.

Typically, we work with universities or training facilities. They're usually quite keen to work with us to be more closely connected with entrepreneurs, because they tend to be good citizens, and also because we offer their students authentic exposure to a leading entrepreneurial community.

For universities, we normally offer an allocation of free tickets for their students, plus give even more students access as volunteers.

### Getting the go from Hosting Partners

As soon as you have your Advisor, we’re going to build a localised buzz around all our possible venue partners, letting them know who the prior hosts were and how they benefitted.

We usually go with the first that comes back saying, "Great! Let's do it. What do you need?" This means they're a true partner and will align with us, work with us well and generally our life easier. (As opposed to people who don't get it and start treating it like a negotiation.)

To get a venue partner in cities where we're not well-recognised, we need to do some social engineering. This has two parts:

1. We create a sense of excitement. This is done by activating as many introduction as possible to the same people and organisations.  If a potential partner hears about us from more and more people, they are more likely to get excited about the possibility.  When people keep hearing about Leancamp, they know it'll be significant so are more likely to act. Name dropping our partners in other cities and our past supporters is helpful, but set expectations to be about building community, not having famous people show up.
2. We create a sense of urgency. We are clear that we are approaching multiple partners, but there can be only one, and we'll work with whoever sees mutual benefit and wants to start right away. Universities are competitive so will often act on the basis of getting in first. (This can also backfire, so we must quickly emphasise the inclusive aspects later, and make specific efforts to include the faculty and community around venues that didn’t get to host.)


It's fine to email them cold, but ideally, you can get warm introductions through the ambassador network and the Leancamp Leaders, so share the list of venues with them.

# Learning from the metrics
 
We email our waiting list and make noise, taking a close look at 2 numbers on our landing page:
. The conversion rate 
. The number of unique visitors 

We watch these numbers from the beginning, and let them inform our Customer Development effort.

At first, both Organisers and Ambassadors should plan on a bit of Customer Development, as we're trying to open a new market for Leancamp, so will need to understand our customers'  buying decisions and how we can make Leancamp valuable to them.

After the first ticket release, we should get to a point where we have a comfortable conversion rate, around 7-10% for now, as this will drop later when we reach out to people who aren't as personally connected to the event.

If the conversion rate is low, below 7% early on or below 2-3% after the break-even point, then we need our Ambassadors to get on the phone and talk to their people about the event. They need to do a little more Customer Development to find out why people in their community aren't buying.  

If the conversion rate is healthy but unique visitors is low, there's an awareness problem, so talk to Ambassadors about what we can do to spread the word better. We probably have to make more noise and reach out to more ambassadors and build more awareness channels. Get the word out on more email lists, blogs, announcements at events, event listings, etc.

Your Advisor will be able to draw on previous Leancamp experiences to shed light on this.

## The point of no return

If our Earlyvangelist tickets don’t sell well, can learn and adapt.  If we have less than a 4-6 weeks though, we have to discuss if we should cancel or postpone the event, and refund everyone. This gives us a safe point of no return.

If we cross it, we should be confident we won't lose money and we know the event will be a success. So we can try to grow and improve it, but it's all upside!

**From now on in, we have a responsibility to the participants for their experience.** If in doubt about a decision, ask what's the right thing to do for the people who've already bought tickets. They have entrusted their money and contributions to us on their behalf.

## Keeping financial risks under control

After the break-even point, we only incur costs that we can pay for with money already collected. This not only makes the event break-even, but also cashflow-positive, which makes our lives a lot easier.

## Iterating and improving

Once we have enough cash to buy some more plane tickets, we invite and announce new leaders, both local and regional, known and unknown.  Start with the Leancamp Leaders since they will seed good sessions.

At this point, we don’t need to worry about financial viability anymore, so we can turn our full attention create the best possible experience for our participants with the money from additional ticket sales.

As we release batches of tickets, we reduce the discount.  This pushes people to buy tickets sooner and allows us to add bigger costs based on the event’s momentum.

Successful events start to profit, so we either improve the event, or pool it the Leancamp account for future events. The Leancamp account is transparent to all organisers and Leancamp Leaders.

## Big names

As we announce more and better-regnised names, it will attract people who just want to sit and listen, rather than participate.  So hold off on announcing the bigger names until later, when we have a good balance and a majority of eager contributors. (See MVP.)

When we have the size and can cover the cost of business class flights, we put the word out to internationally-recognised leaders to see if they’re interested and available.

**Do this with the help of the Leancamp Leaders** as they already have these relationships so it's a friendlier ask and easier for everyone. This makes sure they have consistent contact with Leancamp, so aren't repeating themselves or getting annoyed with multiple requests.

It’s usually best to save the big names for a Leancamp that isn’t the first in a city, when we have the bugs worked out, and have a bit more demand so can offer a bigger audience.

# Your tools and gauges

## Keeping Balance
 
Balance is the key as you grow Leancamp.

We want Leancamp to be a place where people learn novel things, and meet people they don't normally meet in their regular lives. This leads to the best feedback from Leancamp participants: "I met so many helpful people who I'd never meet anywhere else - and they're going to help me do X!" This helps strengthen all the communities involved.

If one particular community dominates Leancamp, our event will suffer. It will be hard to encourage an inclusive culture and hard to leave a legacy of spotting emerging local talent.
 
Ideally, we'd aim for 50%-70% startups and 30-50% non-startups. Within the startup community, we also want to make sure there are multiple "cliques" so one group doesn't dominate.
 
Another rule of thumb is that we want 90%+ active practitioners. (Try to limit consultants to 10% max as the event isn't well-suited for them and we've found that more than 10% consultants drags down the satisfaction ratings for them and everyone.)

Here are a few rules of thumb that we aim for:
. Around 50-60% actual startup founders.
. At least 25%-50% female.
. No more than 10% consultants. (Though up to 10% consultants is a positive thing, if they share their case studies.)
. No more than 50% technical people.
. At least 10% from any outlier community you've invited, like scientists or architects.
. At least 20% designers.

For example, for Leancamp London 2 (2012), we aimed for:
50% startup founders  - Lean Startup London group  - UCL and student enterprise societies  - Minibar / East London startuppers  - Social enterprises
25% UX
5% Scientists
10% Suits (consultants, etc.)  
10% Lean/Agile IT


## Building our local Ambassador network

Think of your city's and region's strengths. Not just in startups. What is your area known for? What are the historic industries? The growing industries? Who are the local leaders?

Scan Meetup.com or the local equivalent. What communities already exist that could add to the diversity of Leancamp?

Having used these questions to explore, you'll start to get a sense of how your Leancamp can be unique and build on local strengths. Old news to you is novel and valuable to the international crowd!

Reach out to leaders in these different communities (thought-leaders, bloggers, event organisers, accelerators, etc.) that aren't necessarily connected to startups, but where mutual learning could be useful. For example, UX people tend to like working on startups, and startups can benefit from learning about UX. You can be creative here, and it's good to err on the side of being inclusive.

## Using your Ambassador network

The main goal of selling tickets is:
. To reach the break-even point 
. Once broken even, to achieve balance with multiple communities.

We achieve balance at Leancamp by working closely with Ambassadors to different local communities, and by giving them access to discount tickets while public tickets are unavailable.  We look at who's bought tickets already and aim to sell more tickets to underrepresented communities in order to keep a good balance.

For example, if you have a strong science industry or consulting industry in your city, getting an ambassador and possibly 1 "seeded" session, plus 5-10 participants from that community will make for a very unique Leancamp!

Ambassadors are useful to:
. Work out what areas of learning will be interesting to their community, and what areas they would seek help from other communities. Leancamp is centreed around the startup community, but the Leancamp event benefits largely even when we act as "information brokers" between other communities.
. Get the word out informally at the beginning. Twitter, personal emails, intros etc.
. Get the word out in "scale mode." Once you've learned a topic that's interesting to their community, they can help get that message on email lists and through other organisations in their world.

We need to make ambassador connections early on, but it gets easier to get them involved as the event becomes closer, so keep trying! If some people haven’t been fully responsive, update them on our progress.
 
At any point, if you notice you're not hitting these balance guidelines, it's time to work with the relevant ambassadors for that community to find out what it'll take to get more of those people to Leancamp.

## The mechanics of ticket releases
 
We watch who's bought tickets, looking at:
What code did they use? What did they say they were? Founder? UXer? Consultant? etc. (So we know what community they're from.)  What did they want to learn?
 
Based on this, we know how we're tracking with balance, so we know who we want to invite more of. If a group is under-represented, we keep public tickets closed, but release special access codes for certain ambassadors to release publicly. (So, if we need more UXers or more people from Startup Group X, we give access codes to those ambassadors.) For a short period, say 2-3 days, they are the only ones who can buy tickets. These codes are usually for the cheapest Earlyvangelist price, even if that deadline has expired.

A useful trick is to set a discount code for unlimited uses and no deadline, but announce them as only 5 tickets available so people act with urgency. (We’d probably extend the code anyways, so this just saves us the trouble.)














## Seeding sessions

We want everyone to learn something immediately useful and applicable at Leancamp.

The magic of Leancamp happens at the beginning of the day, when the community bubbles up and loads of people offer to run sessions. There has never been a Leancamp where the session board wasn't overfilled, with sessions popping into the break and meal-times!

Like most magic tricks, there's a certain preparation underlying it.

We seed (eg. preplan) around 30% of the available sessions. This gets the momentum going for others to propose sessions and also allows us to make sure the event is good.
 
We ask everyone who bought a ticket what they want to learn on the ticket purchase page in Eventbrite. Also add the Ambassadors suggestions to this. Now we have an idea of what sessions we need to seed even though they appear to be regular sessions in the open space planning.
 




You don't need to know exact topics, but a short brainstorm on a few broad spaces is enough.  In addition to topics, ask each Ambassador who in their community has a story or expertise to share that might be interesting to the Leancamp participants.

This is a great discussion to involve some Leancamp Leaders. Their experience will mean they ask you good questions and make good suggestions.

**Tip:** Go for some "interesting" outliers. These may not be well-attended, but often lead to more engaged and informal discussions about practical applications. New tools and techniques are seeded here.




# Showtime! How the day runs

The organising team arrives 2 hours before the start, normally at 8am and starts setup. By 9am, breakfast is being served and people are trickling in.

The session planning starts at 10am.  Sessions run throughout the day, with ample breaks for people to mingle and deepen their connections with each other.

Volunteers are empowered to fix whatever needs fixing. Organisers run around to keep things on schedule, and can dip in to interesting sessions.

The day ends with everyone wrapping up in the same room.  A show of hands of who learned something they CAN apply next week.  Another for those who WILL apply it next week. Feedback forms are handed out, and asked to be completed on the spot. While that happens, people are invited to stand up and quickly share something useful they learned.

Applause. Everyone is directed to the pub!

The volunteers and team gathers for a 10-minute retrospective. Somebody takes notes for the Leancamp Leaders. We clean up quickly, and join everyone else at the pub.

## Session Planning



Session planning is pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  If you haven’t seen it done before, get a Leancamp Leader to take that role. It’s very important to get right as it sets the tone for the day.

If you’ve seen it done and you’d like to give it try yourself, here are some tips:

. It’s all about energy and excitement.  You need to exude happiness and interest in all the potential of the day. You need to be contagious!!!
. There’s an intro deck covering the planning method and Leancamp ethos.  Do this fast, in less than 10 minutes, so you can get to the high-energy part of having everyone on stage.
. Embrace the messiness of the process.
. Remember to get people to write their name and Twitter handle on their card.
. At the beginning, people will get their cards wrong. That’s okay. Stop and help fix them on stage so everyone learns.
. Be transparent. Do what you need to on stage, on mic.
. Keep people being punchy. Urge them to finish up after 30 seconds. Cut them off after 60 by summarising their session.
. Suggest fun and punchy session topics. People are bad at writing their own headlines. Summarise each of their explanations with a punchy topic they can write on their card.  If you’re not sure your title is correct, ask them.
. If the board isn't full at the end of the morning planning session, that's fine. Just try to reschedule the existing sessions to be more heavily-weighted in the morning, and then tell everyone to come back for another short planning session after lunch.
. Adjust the schedule as you go.  If you move any card, make sure you get the approval of that session’s host.
. Encourage cross-over. “Oh, you two could host a discussion on X. Up for it?”

## Volunteer and logistics management

It's best to recruit the a local student group, ideally an entrepreneurship club, who has already worked together. As organisers, you can then delegate most of the day’s logistics to the leader of the student group, who will already know everyone's strengths and will better at delegation and management.

Meet with their leader in advance to talk through the appropriate checklists with them, and work with them as a pair on the preparation on the day.
Measuring Success Overall

We measure success in a few ways:

. Firstly, we have a standard feedback form which includes the Sean Ellis Test and Net Promoter Score.  This gives us an indication of if we’re maintaining Product/Market Fit in new cities, and gives us some indication of how we’re improving.
. If we run experiments with our format, we identify people who have been affected by them in the feedback form, and compare them to people who haven’t. This gives us an idea of if the experiment actually made the event more valuable to people overall.
. We look for sessions that were popular, either in buzz, Twitter chatter or common in the final “what did you learn” session. This shows we’ve spotted a local leader.
. At the end of Leancamp, we do a show of hands to see how many people learned something helpful for an active problem that they can apply next week. We usually hit 95%+.
. We’ve started to ask if anyone made a new connection that can help with a current problem. This will be a more important measurement as Leancamp grows.

# Resources

. For your events page, use the Leancamp site. It has integrations to our social media and other benefits that will save you a lot of duplicate effort.
. For ticket sales, use our Eventbrite account. Again, we have integrations and automated emails that will save a lot of trouble.

# Checklists

## Location selection
We typically look for:
. The venue is operated by people who already support startups and/or innovation.
. Overall venue capacity, 60-200+ depending on our goal
. One large room for everyone, either auditorium seating or open-plan. At 60 people, we can get by with common space if they're happy with the noise.  Beyond 80, we need an auditorium for everyone.
. For every 40 people, a sound-isolated room with capacity for 30-40 people. Session rooms ideally are cabaret style or movable chairs and tables.
. Extra smaller session rooms, 5-15 people are also a good idea, especially if the event is over 100 people.
. A central, common space to post the day's schedule. This will become the hub of the event, so needs to be in an area that can stand 50-60 people around it.
. Wifi that will hold up for techies with multiple devices.
. A/V capabilities in most rooms, including projectors and audio.
. Accessible by public transit.

If any of these are not doable, there are budget implications, so go redo the budgets!

# Seeding Sessions (4-2 weeks before)
. About 30% of the sessions slots covered by people who know have prepped sessions, you'll likely have a full board. 
. A handful of "Intro" sessions. (It's usually best to ask some of the Leancamp Leaders attending if they can cover the intro sessions, and ask them to try to schedule them at the beginning of the day. )
. A handful of more advanced sessions.
. A session on experiments.
. A session on UX
. A session on Customer Development
. A session on metrics.
. A session on a real MVP.
. At least 1 session from each of the Ambassador communities present.



## Creating the schedule for the day (2 weeks before)

* Late start so people have 30-60 minutes to arrive and have coffee/breakfast before the planning session starts.
* One hour planning session to start the day.
* One hour for lunch, so people can mingle.
* At least 2-3 session timeslots before lunch so people have a sense of who they want to talk to at lunch.
* Never more than 3-4 sessions in a row without a coffee break. (So people keep their energy up and can make better personal connections.)
* Sessions are 30 minutes.
* 10 minute gaps between sessions to allow people time to go to the board and decide what’s next.
* Final session slot for everyone to regroup in the same room.
* Know what pub to send everyone to afterwards!

## Leancamp Day Checklists
*dapt times and number of people needed for each Leancamp.
 
### Needed skills:
. Audio/Video Recording and Management 
. Photography
. Twitter
. Lanyrd
 
### Pre-event:
Please arrive at 8am where we will have a detailed debrief but in the meantime you can see a summary of responsibilities below: 

**Tip:** Assign and do the tasks in the order that the customer interacts with Leancamp.  So, start with the signs outside, then setup registration, then the main room, then the other rooms.  (This will keep everything low stress, and allow us leeway if we're running late.)

### Arrival [All]
8am for brief. (2 hours before event starts.) 
In attendance:
. Organisers
. Advisor
. Any Leancamp Leaders attending
. Volunteer Team

One Organiser and the head of the volunteer team take the lead. Leancamp Leaders are asked to jump in whenever helpful. Start by thanking everyone, explaining the overall goal of the day, what they are contributing towards and empowering them to make decisions and act in a way to improve things. 

After explaining all the different roles, and how the day should play out, allocate responsibilities so each student will have at least half a day free to participate in Leancamp sessions.

## Pre-event roles

Camera setup  2 people (45 minutes)
Setup tripods and cameras in each room:
* recording in 720p.
* 7 hours or recording time on card
* Well-positioned for unobstructed view (usually to the side of the stage.)
* Within 2-3 metres of speaker so sound is clear
* Somewhere that nobody will block the line of site
* Plugged-in and have power!
* Start recording now!


### Registration 2 people
Checking tickets on entry, posting up ‘Getting The most out of Leancamp’ &, Session format posters in each session room. Maps & directions posted up in hallways, stairs, etc.. and any information posters everywhere.
Answering any questions attendees have.

### Signs 1-2 people (2 hours)
Certain signs will need to be placed near the building to help people find Leancamp. Put up signs in the order that people arrive. 

There are pre-printed signs. The ones with Leancamp logos are there for you to draw arrows on. Get a felt marker for this.

* Start in the parking lot and/or local transit point, then put up signs towards the building, then into the entrance and towards the registration. 
* Put up a sign at registration to inform people we’re recording.  
* Put up signs to point people to the main room from registration.
* Put up signs to point people to each session room, and the cafe/food area, from the location of session board.
* Draw a map of each room and photocopy it. Put one in front of each session room and a few near the session board.
* Also, place do not enter signs on perimeter doors to prevent people wandering around the building or getting lost.  “Pivot here!” :)


### Catering co-ordinator - 1 head organiser
This should be handled by the person who organised the catering and knows the caterer. They are responsible for making sure the caterer is on time, has what they need, including volunteers to help serve, and that they stick around all day to keep the coffee pouring!

### Schedule Board Setup - 1 person
The schedule board will be a physical grid on a movable structure. Or preprint the schedule grid on A0 sheets. Then, this is just a matter of tacking them to a wall.

. Session times going horizontally on top
. Make sure to include columns for the planning session, breaks, lunch and the final session.
. Session room names going vertically down the left.
. Include the resources (projector, audio, etc.)
. Include the room capacity
. Include the room layout (lecture, cabaret, etc.)
 
### At the scheduling session at 10am:
Get a Leancamp Leader to redirect the event page to the Lanyrd page.
Update the schedule on lanyrd.com (example for Dublin: http://lanyrd.com/2012/leancamp-dublin/add-session/ ) for each session as they are planned. We will redirect leanca.mp/city page to our Lanyrd page when the event starts. Check the board throughout the day for changes, and update Lanyrd.

### Breakfast service 2 people
We will have coffee and food delivered. We need 2 people to take charge of setting this up so the participants can eat when they arrive!

## During Event

### Time-warnings - 1 organiser in the morning, the other afternoon
5-minute warnings can be done by the head organisers - allows them to see everything and double-check cameras.  It also gives the organisers visibility and authority during the event. 

**Tip** Make sure this is done assertively by someone who has had the stage in the planning session or intro. The authority is necessary - people often ignore volunteers who try to call time, but not the organisers.

5 minutes before the end of each session, quickly pop into each session room and announce "5 minutes left." Interrupt the speaker mid-sentence, it's okay. You need to move quickly to cover all the session rooms.  

When time's up, do the same again. Poke your head in and firmly announce time is up.

Decide now who will do this in the morning, and who will do it in the afternoon.

 
 


### Room stewards - 1 person per 2-3 rooms
Between sessions, if sessions get too big for their room, send someone from the session to find a room to trade with. If you need to, you can feel free to ask one of the participants to help, so that you don’t need to abandon your current task/role. (A/V people for example.)

. Ensure that sessions start on time. If the last session is running more than 5 minutes over time, take over the stage and ask everyone who wants to continue to do so in a common area like the cafe.
. If you see a room is getting too busy, try to swap them with another bigger room that’s under capacity.
. Help the session host if they need help with the projector or audio.
. Make sure the cameras are always recording and aimed the right way. Check every session.
. Anything else that’s wrong, you are hereby authorized to step up and fix it!

### Twitter 1 person
Tweeting on the Leancamp account.  We want the @leancamp account to be the single source for all the Leancamp stuff happening on Twitter. Retweet ANY interesting updates on the #leancamp hashtag. (Watch out for spammers though - we’ll likely be trending!)

Updates, room changes, retweeting others on the #leancamp hashtag, answering questions.

### Photographer 1 person
Action pictures and people are great. Also, please try to capture as many whiteboards and flipcharts and notes over peoples shoulder (with permission!) as possible, especially during sessions in case people want to take their stuff with them. After the event, somebody should collate and make a book out of it all.
If you can, post live using tag #leancamp on Twitter and Flickr.
PLEASE remember to take your cards to Central Video so they can be uploaded to our master hard drive.

Also, try to collect and save as much “collateral” as possible. All the paper and stuff that people write on should be collected so we can review or even make a book out of it too.  

## During Lunch

### Catering 2 people
The catering people may need some extra help serving here.

## Ambassador Invite

The first Leancamp [City] is on [date] and we need your help, both in guidance and in getting the word out. I think there's some potential in sharing how Lean Startup could benefit _______ and how we could apply ________ in startups. Would you have a moment to discuss this potential?

If it’s promising to you, we’d like to invite you to be a Leancamp Ambassador, to help get the word out and help us tailor the event for your community. (Not to mention discount codes!)

Leancamp is a non-profit, multi-disciplinary knowledge-sharing event loosely centered around Lean, Agile and Design-led businesses. It's endorsed by loads of friendly, famous startup types like Eric Ries, Alex Osterwalder, and John Mullins.

We bring in businesses actually applying these approaches, so we share practical insights about what works and doesn't. A wider range of perspectives really helps everyone learn more and progress faster.

Being an Ambassador is easy -  helping get the word out on your blog/twitter/meetup group and discussing good topics so we can find the best knowledge-sharing opportunities.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Up for discussing this an afternoon/evening this week?

# FAQ

## How do we bring high-profile leaders to our city?

Don't worry about the higher-profile contributors and speakers directly. Taking care that the existing local and regional contributors are meeting others with similar value and experience will create strong bonds into your community. The big names will hear about this through their trusted network (including many of the Leancamp Leaders) and then will be more inclined to come next time. Why? Because they want to give back, but they want to give back to local leaders who can multiply their value, and since they're so busy, they go where you can promise to introduce them to people they want in their network.


## What about sponsors?
Leancamp is for us by us. One of our biggest steps in an effort to make organising easier was to simply say no to sponsorship money.  This revealed a better alternative - that if sponsors wanted to actually contribute rather than simply buying access to our audience, they would still help out! Our no sponsor policy not only helped reduce our workloads, it acted as a natural filter to select genuinely aligned people and organisations to take part. 

A few examples of how would-be sponsors can help instead:

. Buy tickets!  If we're not hitting our sales targets, organisations can buy tickets to give away.
. Send their talented people to share and run sessions. Turn them into ambassadors and they get the benefit of sponsoring without the cost!
. Promote us! By becoming ambassadors and promoting us, they get the association in a more genuine way.

## Can my organisation get credit if they aren't hosting?

Like with sponsors, the best way for any organisation to benefit from Leancamp is through it's people.  We encourage people to represent their organisations, so as Organisers, you're welcome to bang your own drum! Leancamp is also up for cross-proomotion.

However, we need to stay consistent to the values that brought us here, so as organisers, we are emphasising our relationship with you as people first. Opening the door to more logos or bending the rules in other ways can have a negative effect - both in alienating others in the local community who might want to contribute, and also costing time by managing expectations of would-be sponsors.

The same is true for you as it is with others who want to sponsor. The best way to gain exposure and good-will for your organisation is to lead as individuals, and point to your organisation in your Leancamp website profiles, sessions and verbally when you're on stage.

## Should we partner with conferences?

Conferences are great hosts for Leancamp. We've done deals with TNW Conference and Pirate Summit where they offered to cover our downside risk by covering our costs if we didn't hit enough ticket sales. In exchange, they could send everyone in their conference to Leancamp for free. 

This works quite well because:
. We can hit 60 participants quite easily, which is a solid number for satisfaction scores.
. We don't have to worry about a lot of the venue logistics.
. We can invite their speakers to be participants and ambassadors.
. We can offer a much lower ticket prices for people who aren't attending the conference.


## What about people who sell stuff?
Leancamp is about entrepreneurship, so if people are trying to make money, that's great! Leancamp is a great channel for selling information products, workshops or other general forms of community engagement. Often, our most valuable contributors are authors or would-be authors.

It's up to you if you want to endorse them by placing their profile on the event page. If you feel they are misaligned, or dodgy/sleezy in any way, then you don't have to promote them. However, they're still welcome to propose their session like anyone else. 

The judgement you should place on this is if you think what they offer is of potential value to the community. Remember, we're acting in the best interest of our ticket-holders. 

Also, you should try to be neutral in your assessment. Leancamp works because it's a place for open discussion. Let the participants discuss what works and doesn't for them.

##  How large are organizing teams usually?
 
1-2 main organisers.
1 Advisor
5+ ambassadors to help with promo, topics and community. Usually around 5 ambassadors are quite involved, and there’s a list of 10 or so more Ambassadors on the email list who help out when they can.

On the day:
1-2 additional Leancamp Leaders in attendance
3-6 student volunteers
